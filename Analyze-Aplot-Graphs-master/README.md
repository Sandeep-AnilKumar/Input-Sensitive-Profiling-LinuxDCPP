# Analyze-Aplot-Graphs
This Java program will find methods that are specific to a given input.
Please collect all your .aprof files for each input in different folders. So each folder corresponds to each input. 
Place all these folders in a folder (in my case aprof-outputs).
Replace the path in line 18 with your base folder path. 
   File base_folder = new File("//home//pavan//aprof-outputs") (line no 18 in java programm)
   
output
-------
A file input_specific_methods.txt will be created. 
each line in this file contains folder(which corresponds to a input) and method which is specific to that folder(i.e input)
